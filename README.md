ROC &amp; SVM LAB 
for this lab I started by changing the train_test_split function to 30%. Then, I attemped to add Support Vector Macines to compare the ROC curve of it to the Logistic Regression that was provided. I messed around with a few different C values. The Precision Recall Curve was already provided and so im confused on what this step is asking for.
Please note: I set probability = True for my SVM learning algorithm to try and emulate logistic regression in a sense. I found that SVM seems like its more sensitive to outliers compared to the Logistic regression algorithm. 
after comparing the graphs. It seems like Logistic Regression has a more accurate prediction while SVM seems to have false predictions more frequent.
